# GOV.UK Design System Redirect

This is a simple CloudFoundry app that redirects all requests to our service
domain.

We use it to redirect the cloudapps.digital domain we used during private beta
(which may be bookmarked by our private beta partners, and is referred to in
documentation ) to our service domain (design-system.service.gov.uk)
